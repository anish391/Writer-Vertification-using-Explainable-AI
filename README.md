# Writer-Verification-using-Explainable-AI
The aim of this project is to use Deep Learning methodologies in order to develop a Machine Learning system which can provide explainable features. As Machine Learning models become more complex, the task of producing an interpretable version of the model becomes more difficult. Hence, it is necessary to generate a model which gives an accurate output, but also explains why we got the output.

We use a dataset of handcrafted features of the word “and” for this purpose. The dataset is used with Frozen Auto-Encoders with 15 Neural Networks(for the 15 "and" word features) in order to obtain explainable feature values for any given sample of the word.
